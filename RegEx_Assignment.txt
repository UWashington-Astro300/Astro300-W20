RegEx Assignment
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Part I - Regex Golf is an exercise of trying to find the shortest
regular expression that matches all strings in one given set, but does
not match any of the strings in a different given set. Like golf, a
lower score is better.

For example, this is the content of the file "golf_00":

00 one
01 two
02 three

00 four
01 five
02 six

The goal is to find a regex that will match the top set (one, two,
three), but not match ANY of the bottom set (four, five, six).

This will work:  grep -E 'one|two|three' golf_00

But that regex took 13 characters - Not a good score

This is better:  grep -E 't|n' golf_00

That regex took 3 characters - A much better score.

I have given you 9 holes to play (golf_01 .. golf_09).

The files in the directory Astro300-A19/Data/GOLF

 - You can ONLY use the -E flag. No -v or -o flags allowed!
 - They get harder as you go on.
 - Bonus points for the lowest score.
 - The approximate pars are listed below.
 - Some holes can be played under par. Some not.
 - If you are stuck, I have given you some helpful(?) clues in golf_HINTS

Hole | 01 | 02 | 03 | 04 | 05 | 06 | 07 | 08 | 09 |
---------------------------------------------------
Par  | 3  | 5  | 3  | 6  | 5  | 9  | 8  | 12 | 7  |   Total = 58


------------------------------------------------------------------------


Part II - The text of the novel "Martin Chuzzlewit" by Charles Dickens
is contained in the file "Astro300-W20/Novel.txt"

Determine the letter frequency distribution for "Novel.txt".
(convert everything to lowercase).

Determine the 5 most common WORDS in "Novel.txt" with length >= 7 letters
(ignore case).

Determine the longest word in "Novel.txt". If there is more than one list
them all


------------------------------------------------------------------------


------------------------------------------------------------------------

Part III - Codebreaking

Take a look at: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_analysis

You are given 3 coded messages (code1.txt ... code3.txt) in the directory:

Astro300-A19/Data/GOLF/Ravenclaw

The messages are coded with a simple character substitution (i.e. x = a,
2 = e, for ALL occurrences of "x" and "2" in the message).  Each file
has a different substitution.  All of the inter-word spaces and
punctuation have been removed and case is ignored.

Determine which of the 3 coded messages are real messages and which
ones are decoy messages of garbage (random distributions).

RAVENCLAW Section -  Remember doing (or nor doing) these sections will
                     NOT effect your grade!
------------------------------------------------------------------------


Decode the real message(es) and tell me the source of the quotes.  All
real messages are quotes from the popular geek cannon.  Remember that
all of the inter-word spaces and punctuation have been removed and
case is ignored, so words may break across lines.

Hint: If you think z=T, j=H, and x=E in code1.txt use:

% cat code1.txt | tr zjx THE

You can expand your substitution list as you go along.
